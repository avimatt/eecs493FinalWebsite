			<h2> Background </h2>
			<p>Our Application, EECS Help Queue. Our goal, to decrease friction in holding office hours across all EECS computing classes. The EECS Help Queue app is designed to be a mobile workstation for instructors conducting office hours in CAEN labs at the University of Michigan. We host digital queues of students that are fully mutable with all requested functionality to go along a with clean slick UI design. A student must only sign up to the queue online and let us do the rest. When he or she becomes the top member of the queue, the instructor will go to his or her workstation and give the student help. Our app provides the instructor with all the tools he or she needs </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<h2> Features </h2>
			<p>Login, Choose a class, Submit a Request, View a request, Start and End Visiting, View maps of CAEN Labs, Delete Requests, Begin and End Queue, Request instructor status, Clear, Queue Swipe to Refresh, Stats, and an EasterEgg </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-4">
			<h2> Version 2.0 </h2>
			<p>In the future, we look to implement live updates from the web server. We are also looking into do a student side application to make the queue easier to monitor for students. The existence of a administration page for each class is also being looked into, as it would allow a class to have multiple queues, and manage announcements. We are looking forward to implementing these new features in the coming months!</p>
